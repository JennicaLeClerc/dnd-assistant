Although not a weapon per se, it can be used in combat to deliver ranged touch attacks.The heavy aspergillum combines the properties of a common aspergillum with those of a heavy mace and is greatly favored by members of the Impilturan church of Ilmater. A heavy aspergillum can hold up to 3 flasks of holy water. In addition to serving as a common aspergillum, it can also be used in melee combat. When a button on the shaft is pressed, tiny holes open in the mace head, allowing holy water to touch a creature struck by the weapon. Each use of the weapon in this manner uses one flask of holy water per attack whether or not the attack is successful. If the wielder has multiple attacks per round with the weapon, the holy water can be released multiple times in one round (but no more than once per attack) until it is depleted. A heavy aspergillum may also be used to make ranged touch attacks with holy water in the manner of a normal aspergillum.Pouring a flask of holy water into an aspergillum or heavy aspergillum is a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity.",

It can move only at half speed and cannot charge or run. If you control the trailing rope by succeeding at an opposed Strength check while holding it, the entangled creature can move only within the limits that the rope allows.

This attack does not work against a character in heavy armor, or against most monsters that do not wear clothing (though it does work against a monster with shaggy fur). If the touch attack is successful, you make an opposed grapple check, using the size modifier for the entangling pole (+4 for a two-handed weapon) instead of your own size. If you win the opposed check, you have a hold on the target, but you do not deal any damage. If you lose, you fail to start the grapple.To maintain the grapple, you do not need to move into your opponent's space. The entangling pole holds your opponent 10 feet away from you. While you maintain the grapple, you do not have the option to damage or pin your opponent. Your opponent can try to escape or wriggle free, attack with a light weapon, or cast a spell with no somatic components and a casting time of 1 standard action.An entangling pole can also be used as a normal weapon, dealing the damage shown details but not entangling the opponent.An entangling pole has reach.

Once the garrote has begun to deal damage after a garrote attack, the attacker can link the two ends and twist the grips into their locked position. This maintains strangling pressure on the victim even after the attacker lets go. The victim continues to make grapple checks (each one opposed by the last attack roll the attacker made) until freed or unconscious.The DC for the Disable Device check to free a victim from a locked garrote is 10 if the character attempting the task has Exotic Weapon Proficiency (locking garrote, or 20 otherwise. If someone other than the victim makes the attempt, a -5 circumstance penalty applies to the check unless the victim is held, unconscious, or otherwise kept from moving. A character attempting to remove a locking garrote from his or her own neck suffers the same penalty on the Disable Device check, this time for working blind. Naturally it's impossible for any character to take 10 or take 20 on this check unless the victim trapped in the device is already dead. Smashing the locking garrote leaves it frozen in the locked position.",

    "description": "A lasso is little more than a thin rope knotted with a slipknot that creates a large loop. The loop is thrown at a target and the other end is pulled when the loop strikes, causing it to tighten around the target. You can throw the lasso at a Medium-size or smaller target, which requires a ranged touch attack. If the touch attack succeeds, you immediately start a grapple against the target with a -4 penalty on your roll (all normal grapple modifiers apply). If the opponent is grappled by the lasso, you may use an attack to attempt to trip the target. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the lasso to avoid being tripped. You cannot damage or pin the opponent with the lasso, and you are not considered to be grappling when using the lasso to grapple. If you drop the lasso, the grappled creature only needs to succeed at a DC 10 grapple or Escape Artist check to get out of the lasso.If you secure one end of the lasso to the saddle of your mount, you can use the mount's size and strength modifiers for your grapple checks.The maximum range for a lasso cannot exceed the length of the rope, minus 5 feet.From Book of Exalted Deeds: A lasso is an entangling weapon that deals no damageH but it entangles only parts of an opponent's body. When you use a lasso to entangle your opponent's arms, you make a ranged touch attack against your target. A lasso's maximum range is 4 feet. If you hit, the target is partially entangled, taking a -2 or] attack rolls and a -4 penalty on effective Dexterity. The creature's speed is not reduced, and it can still charge or run, but you control the trailing rope by succeeding at an opposed Strength check while holding it, the lassoed creature can only move within the limits that the rope allows. If the lassoed creature attempts to cast a spell, it must succeed on a DC 15 Concentration check or be unable to cast the spell.The lassoed creature can escape with a DC 20 Escape Artist check as a full-round action. The lasso has 2 hp and can broken with a DC 23 Strength checkâ€”also a full-round action. Alternatively, you can use a lasso to make trip attacks. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the lasso to avoid being tripped.",

A creature wielding a lynxpaw in only one hand can't use it as a double weapon and can only use one end of the weapon in any given round.A proficient character can make trip attacks with a lynxpaw's chain.

The weapon is worn tied to the wielder's wrist in a specially designed sheath. When you attack with a quickrazor, you flick it out in a quick, slashing circle, catching the hilt in your hand at the end of the arc and then snapping it back into its rest.Because of this flicking technique, drawing a quickrazor is always a free action, but at the end of your action, you must stow the quickrazor in order to use it properly again on your next turn. Stowing the weapon after attacking with it in this fashion is a free action. Because you must stow the quickrazor at the end of each attack with it, you are treated as unarmed during other creatures' actions.if you draw a quickrazor and simply wield it instead of using its intended attack method, it counts as an improvised weapon, imposing a -2 penalty on attack rolls even if you have the appropriate Exotic Weapon Proficiency feat.Quickrazors are easier to conceal than most weapons, and they grant a +4 bonus on Sleight of Hand checks to conceal them. Quickrazors grant a +2 bonus on Bluff checks made to feint in combat.Attaching a quickrazor and sheath to your wrist so that it can be wielded properly is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity.

A weighted sleeve consists of one or more metal weights sewn into a sleeve hem. Tailors who incorporate these weapons into finely made garments take care to spread out the weight so that the clothing hangs normally. In simpler peasant versions, a small pocket just inside the cuff of each sleeve holds a single metal ball weighing about 1 pound. Typically, both of a garment's sleeves are weighted.To use this weapon, the wearer first swings the sleeve around to build momentum, much as if it were a sling. instead of releasing a missile, however, the user simply clubs the target with the weight. Building up sufficient momentum is a move-equivalent action, so only one blow with each sleeve is normally possible in a round. Attacking with both sleeves simultaneously incurs the standard penalties for fighting with two weapons. The wielder might also alternate between the left and right sleeves, striking with one and building up speed with the other during one round, then striking with the second sleeve and building momentum with the first on the following round. This tactic incurs the standard penalty for using a weapon in the offhand each round.Wearing a garment with weighted sleeves as part of a disguise is a favorite trick of assassins. Once the assassin has carried out his mission, he can simply discard the weights in the nearest convenient dustbin or pond and continue posing as an unarmed servant or guest in the house, even if a search is conducted.",
